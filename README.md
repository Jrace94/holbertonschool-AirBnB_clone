# Project: AirBnB clone - The console

## Description of the project:

	Our Project named ´AirBnB clone - The console´, is the first segment of the ´AirBnB Clone Project´ at Holberton School. The final goal is to deploy a replica of the AirBnB Website.

## Description of the command interpreter:

	The command interpreter allow us the entering of commands and then executes those commands to the operating system. For this project we are going to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
	- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
	- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
	- Update attributes of an object
	- Destroy an object

### How to start it

	To start the command interpreter, we must run the console.py script. $ ./console.py
